# 1. Introduction
COVID pandemic has impacted the world in unimaginable ways: work from home and zoom meetings are becoming norms; overseas travel almost comes to a complete halt; we might even start to forget that COVID confirmed cases and death are human beings, and not just numbers in a statistics. For the pandemic to be over, we need to achieve herd immunity either through recovery from infection or vaccine [@charumilind_craven_lamb_sabow_wilson_2021]. However, despite being eager of seeing the end to this calamity, people might also have worries and beliefs that make them hesitant to take the vaccine. 

Imperial College London Big Data Analytical Unit and YouGov [@jones_sarah_2020] conducted a survey that measures the people's behaviours in response to COVID-19. This data visualisation makeover will focus on the willingness of people in various countries to take the COVID vaccine.
