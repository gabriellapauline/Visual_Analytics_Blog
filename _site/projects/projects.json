In this project, 3 key analysis will be performed:\r\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\nClustering analysis\r\nRegression Modeling \r\nMotivation\r\nBack to top\r\nWith the limited police resources and possible adverse impact when crime occurs, analytics on crime has been done as far back as in the 1800s (Hunt, 2019). Crime occurrence was found to have spatial patterns, and thus predictive analytics should be possible. However, mixed results were obtained in the research to determine whether predictive policing results to lower crime rates (Meijer & Wessels, 2019). Thus, it is more beneficial to use the analytics to determine areas with higher risk of crime and to discover the underlying factors to the increased risk.\r\nTraditionally, crime analysis is done manually or through a spreadsheet program (RAND Corporation, 2013). This project would give the users an easier way to do the analysis using a web application.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives\r\nBack to top\r\nThis project aims to deliver an interactive user web application interface, whereby users are able to apply actionable insights based on the 3 key analysis\r\nUnderstanding hot spots of crime rate, with a visual map of Greater London\r\nClustering of areas based on different techniques\r\nForecast possible hot spots based on different regression models\r\nTo provide data-driven insights to inform preventative measures such as warnings and allocation of police force resources and influence ward planning policies\r\nDatasets\r\nBack to top\r\nA borough includes wards, which is the primary unit of English electoral geography for civil parishes and district councils. There are a total of 32 boroughs in Greater London, excluding the City of London.\r\n1. MPS Ward Level Crime (historic: Apr 2010 onward)\r\nMonthly data from Apr 2010 to Dec 2018\r\nDimensions include: BoroughName, Wardcode, wardname, major category, minor category\r\n2. MPS Ward Level Crime (most recent 24 months)\r\nMonthly data from Apr 2010 to Dec 2018\r\nDimensions include: BoroughName, Wardcode, wardname, major category, minor category\r\n3. Land Area & Population - Ward\r\nYearly data from 2011 to 2050\r\nDimensions include: BoroughName, Wardcode, wardname\r\nAttributes: Population, Hectares, Pop Per square km\r\n4. Income of Taxpayers\r\nData every 2 years from 1999 to 2018\r\nDimensions: Code, Area\r\nAttributes: Mean of Tax, Medium of Tax\r\n5. Economic Activity Rate, Employment Rate and Unemployment Rate by Ethnic Group & Nationality, Borough\r\nYearly data from 2005 to 2019\r\nDimensions: Code, Area\r\nAttributes: Employment rate, Unemployment rate, Economic inactivity rate\r\n6. Geographical Map of London (LOAC) SHP data\r\n7. Local Authority District Names and Codes\r\nDimension: BoroughName, Area Code\r\nProposed Scope and Methodology\r\nBack to top\r\n1. Data cleaning and preparation\r\nDatasets should all have consistent depth (ward VS borough) and the same duration\r\nUsing dplyr package, immediate operation and data-manipulation\r\n2. Choose the right R package to visualize: \r\nBased on our project objectives, we came out with storyboards and evaluated different versions of our interactive visualisation application. With our shortlisted storyboard in mind, we explored the R packages required to build the visualisation.\r\n3. Data visualization and Analysis\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nExploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)\r\nFinding spatial hotspots, outliers and anomalies of wards with high crime rate\r\n\r\nTime series of geo-spatic data\r\nUnderstanding how crime rates have changed over the years, broken down by wards\r\n\r\nClustering of Location Authority District : Finding similar LAD\r\nHierarchical Clustering (Hcluster)\r\nHierarchical Clustering with Spatial Constraints (GeoCluster)\r\nClustering of Spatio-Temporal Data (STC Model)\r\n\r\nRegression: Forecasting of crime rate in each LAD\r\nGeographically weighted regression (GWR)\r\nGeographically And Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR)\r\n\r\n4.
