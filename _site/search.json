I am currently pursuing Master of IT in Business degree from Singapore Management University while doing internship in UOB Asset Management. Coding aside, I enjoy eating and baking. For me, data is a treasure chest that gives you a hope of making the world a little bit better, one insight at a time.\r\nI hope you have a good day, God bless you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
